PLEASE NOTE : no super-user credentials are needed for any of these installations.

The current WOSS version has the following compatibilities:
  -   https://woss.dei.unipd.it/#libraries
 
Requirements
 
  -   Download the recommended Acoustic Toolbox library from https://woss.dei.unipd.it/#libraries
      and follow installation instructions. The directory path that contains
      the binaries should be in the $PATH environment.
  -   woss::BellhopArrSyntax::BELLHOP_CREATOR_ARR_FILE_SYNTAX_1 is compliant with Bellhop arr file 
      syntax of the acoustic toolbox library up until the 16 Aug 2016 version.
  -   woss::BellhopArrSyntax::BELLHOP_CREATOR_ARR_FILE_SYNTAX_2 is compliant with Bellhop arr file 
      syntax of the acoustic toolbox library >= 31 March 2019 version. 
      This is the new factory value. 
  -   WOSS is now requiring NetCDF4 with HDF5 support in order to be able to read the latest GEBCO 2019 dataset.
  -   IF you wish to compile NetCDF4 software features, download the recommended HDF5, NetCDF library for C and 
      the C++4 from https://woss.dei.unipd.it/#libraries
      HDF5 and NetCDF4 have to be built with support for dynamic libraries. 
      Please refer to NetCDF documentation for comprehensive set of installation instructions. 
      Please note that the option --prefix is strongly suggested.
      A simple installation script is given here as example: 
          - install the HDF5 library with
            - ./configure --enable-shared --prefix=<optional_netcdf4_install_path>
            - make
            - make check
            - make install (should any test fail, based on test failure severity you could still give the install command)
          - install the NETCDF C library with
            - ./configure --prefix=<optional_netcdf4_install_path> --disable-dap --enable-shared --enable-netcdf-4 CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -I<optional_netcdf4_install_path>/include" LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L<optional_netcdf4_install_path>/lib"
            - make 
            - make check
            - make install (should any test fail, based on test failure severity you could still give the install command)
          - install the NETCDF4 C++ library with
            - ./configure --prefix=<optional_netcdf4_install_path> --enable-shared CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -I<optional_netcdf4_install_path>/include" LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L<optional_netcdf4_install_path>/lib"
            - make
            - make check
            - make install (should any test fail, based on test failure severity you could still give the install command)
  -   IF you want to compile NS-Miracle features download the latest version of NS2 allinone and of NS-Miracle 
      from the official git repository https://github.com/signetlabdei/nsmiracle:
      Read documentation provided in the above link for installation instructions.
  -   If you want to use WOSS with world data, download and extract the provided databases. 
      Download the GEBCO 2020 2D Fifteen seconds zip archive from https://woss.dei.unipd.it/#libraries
      or any of the previous datasets from https://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/historical_data_sets
      and put them in the same directory.


How to install WOSS library

  1) extract the compressed file in a directory of your choice;
  2) open a terminal and cd into that directory;
  3) run './autogen.sh' 
  4) run './configure' with the following options:
        --with-ns-allinone=<ns2-allinone_path> (optional) see examples below in order to avoid gcc-13 compilation error.
        --with-nsmiracle=<ns-miracle_path> (optional) see examples below in order to avoid gcc-13 compilation error.
        --with-netcdf4=<NetCDF4_installation_path> (optional, the same mentioned in the Requirements section, if NetCDF4
                                                  was installed with no --prefix, the default path SHOULD be
                                                  /usr/local)
        --with-pthread (optional but recommended)
        --prefix=<path_where_libraries_will_be_installed> (optional)
           this path should be the same one used with NS-Miracle installation.
           Please refer to NS-Miracle documentation for more info
  5) run 'make'
  6) run 'make check' in order to run WOSS tests
  6) run 'make install'

Examples

The following line would install WOSS with pthread, and NetCDF4, but with no NS2/NS-Miracle support (stand-alone library).

./configure --with-netcdf4=<NetCDF4_install_path> --with-pthread --prefix=<path_where_libraries_will_be_installed>

The next line would install WOSS with NetCDF4, NS2 and NS-Miracle support and it removes the gcc-13 overloaded-virtual warning

CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -Wno-overloaded-virtual" ./configure --with-netcdf4=<NetCDF4_install_path> --with-ns-allinone=<ns2-allinone_path> --with-nsmiracle=<ns-miracle_path> --with-pthread --prefix=<path_where_libraries_will_be_installed>
