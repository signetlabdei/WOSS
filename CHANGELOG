WOSS changelog:

please note: WOSS is in its development stage, API changes will be limited at minimum, 
             but this cannot be guaranteed. 


v1.0.0 - release version

v1.0.1 - woss::Coord, woss::CoordZ : latitude, longitude and depth are now double value (instead of woss::PDouble)
       - woss::ResPressureTxtDb, woss::ResTimeArrTxtDb : added a space_sampling feature
       - woss::WossDbManager : the managing of custom enviromental data has been reworked, check doxygen documentation
         and test_aloha_no_dbs.tcl
       - WossCbrModule : new class added

v1.1.0 - databases : data from WOA2009 has been released; these files are fully compatible with the 2005 version.
       - woss::CustomDataContainer : bugs fixed.
       - woss::Location : class for positioning added. 
       - WossPosition : WOSS now expect a WossPosition as Miracle Position class, see updated tcl examples for usage.
       - WossWpPosition : class has been reworked. 
       - woss::WossCreatorContainer: class has been added.
       - woss::WossCreator, woss::BellhopCreator : interfaces expanded, they now handles custom values. 
         for woss::Location objects. In this way transmitter movement is properly handled. 
       - woss::ACToolboxWoss : bugs fixed.
       - woss::BellhopWoss : bugs fixed.
       - woss::TimeReference, woss::TimeReferenceTcl : classes for providing WOSS a time reference.
       - woss::RandomGenerator, woss::RandomGeneratorTcl: classes for providing WOSS a random numbers generators.
       - WossRandomGenerator, WossRandomGeneratorTcl : hooks for NS2 random generators.
       - woss::DefHandler : now can set and return a time reference and a random generator objects.
       - woss::SSP : class has been updated to work with woss::RandomGenerator.

v1.2.0 - woss::RandomGenerator : bug fixed.
       - woss::WossManagerResDbMT : some bugs fixed in thread allocation.
       - woss::ACToolboxWoss : bug fixed.
       - woss::ResTimeArrBinDb, woss::ResTimeArrBinDbCreator, woss::ResPressureBinDb, woss::ResPressureBinDbCreator :
         classes for storing computed results in a binary file.
       - ChannelEstimator, ChannelEstimatorPlugin : now works with MAC address instead of IP address to permit power control at MAC level.
         this now requires that only the MLL ARP table has to be filled instead of routing tables and ARP tables.
         Space sampling capability added.
       - woss::Transducer : transducer definitions added.
       - woss::TransducerHandler : transducer handler definitions added.
       - woss::BellhopWoss : addded beam pattern capabilities.
       - woss::BellhopCreator : added custom transducer capabilities.
       - woss::Location : default comparison_distance value changed, added support for dinamic vertical
         beam pattern orientation.
       - WossPosition, WossWpPosition : added support for dynamic vertical beam pattern orientation.
       - UnderwaterMPhyBpsk : some tcl variables renamed. PLEASE SEE SOURCE CODE AND EXAMPLES FOR MORE INFO
       - UwMPhyBpskTransducer, WossMPhyBpsk : added support for woss::Transducer, to properly simulate SPL and 
         energy consumption.
       - added transducer descriptions of BTech, ITC, ITT, RESON.
       - new tcl sample added. 
       - old samples: now channel estimation properly works
       - doxygen basic samples page removed, all the comments are inline within the tcl files.

v1.3.0 - WossChannelModule : channel_eq_time_, channel_symbol_time_ and channel_eq_threshold_db_ introduced, channel_time_resolution_ removed;
															- the channel now coherently sums all taps at channel_symbol_resolution_ 
                              - from channel_eq_snr_threshold_db_ the attenuation threshold is calculated
                              - the first tap that has txloss <= channel_eq_att_threshold_db is found
															- then all taps after the above tap + channel_equalization_time_ are incoherently summed
                                   if channel_equalization_time_ == 0 no eq is done
                                   if channel_equalization_time_ < 0 then all taps are incoherently summed 
															- all taps after channel_equalization_time_ are left untouched
       - Altimetry concept introduced.
       - Altimetry time evolution introduced.
       - Woss, WossManager, WossCreator: time evolution concept introduced.
       - WossDbManager: custom SSP with time evolution introduced.
       - WOSS can now be installed: with/without NS-Miracle, with/without NetCDF, with/without pthread
